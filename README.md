* Admin can add product, update and delete product. Admin can also see all the products and all the user lists. But admin can't add product to cart. Only admin can visit the dashboard(private route has been implemented).
* By default all the users are Customer. Customer can see products and add product to cart but user need to login to the site otherwise user can't add product to cart.

  This is a very basic website, for now, lots of updates and features will be added soon In Sha Allah.
